Autoencoder testing placeholder.

There are issues that I would like to resolve for the bwc project, and I thought that I should isolate the issues by checking the reconstruction error by using a simpler autoencoder.  I'll copy most of the code from bwc and try out different network architectures to pick the one that has the lowest reconstruction error for the bwc project.  Code to be checked in in the near future as I make progress in trying out multiple architectures.
